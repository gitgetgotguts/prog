**Project Resilience: Investment Proposal**

**1. Executive Summary**

Project Resilience is a scalable, high-margin enterprise addressing a critical failure in the Tunisian agricultural supply chain. We are not a tech company; we are an operationally-focused logistics business that uses proven technology to solve a painful, expensive, and persistent problem for smallholder farmers: the volatile cost and unreliable supply of quality animal feed.

By establishing a network of decentralized production nodes, we convert locally sourced barley into fresh, nutrient-dense animal fodder, delivered daily to our customers. Our model is built on operational efficiency, offering farmers a three-part value proposition: **cost reduction, increased productivity, and supply chain stability.**

We are seeking **23,620 TND** in initial capital to launch a fully-funded, de-risked operation. This investment will establish our first production unit, fund the acquisition of a dedicated delivery vehicle, and cover all operational expenses including rent. This enables us to capture a projected **3,630 TND in monthly gross profit**, ensuring a rapid path to self-sustainability and scalable growth.

**2. The Problem: A Failing Supply Chain**

(This section remains unchanged as the market problem is the same)

The Tunisian smallholder farmer, particularly in the dairy and livestock sectors, is caught in a vice. They are crushed between rising operational costs and stagnant sale prices. The primary driver of this economic pain is their reliance on an unstable animal feed supply chain.

*   **Price Volatility:** The cost of traditional compound feed (corn/soy mix) is tied to global commodity markets and import logistics. A 50kg bag has recently reached 81 TND (1.62 TND/kg), a price that is unsustainable for small operations.
*   **Unreliable Supply:** State procurement systems are inefficient, and logistical bottlenecks are common. Farmers often waste significant time and money traveling to secure feed, with no guarantee of availability.
*   **Nutritional Inefficiency:** Dry, processed feeds are less digestible than fresh fodder, leading to suboptimal animal health and productivity (milk yield, weight gain).

This is not a temporary inconvenience; it is a structural crisis that threatens the livelihood of thousands of farmers and the stability of the local food supply.

**3. The Solution: "Project Resilience" - A Logistics Business First**

(This section remains unchanged as the solution is the same)

Our solution is direct and built on proven, robust technology. We are not selling machines; we are selling a reliable, affordable supply of fresh feed.

*   **The Technology (The "How"):** We use hydroponic systems in controlled environments to sprout barley. This is not experimental tech; it is a well-understood process. Our key innovation is in the operational model. The system multiplies the input: **1 kg of barley seed produces 5 kg of fresh, highly nutritious fodder in a 7-day cycle.**
*   **The Business Model (The "What"):** We operate a local production "node" capable of producing **137 kg of fresh fodder daily.** We sign up a dense cluster of local farmers for daily delivery and price our product at a **20% discount** to the farmer's *real* cost of traditional feed.
*   **The Impact (The "Why"):** We provide a cheaper, higher-quality feed with perfect price stability and 100% supply reliability. This directly translates to lower costs, healthier animals, higher yields, and greater profitability for our customers.

### **Page 2: The Numbers - Financial Projections & Capital Requirements (Revised)**

**1. Unit Economics: A High-Margin Operation**

Our profitability is driven by a deep understanding and ruthless control of our costs. The following figures are based on our planned **137 kg/day** production unit and now include the fixed monthly cost of rent.

*   **Competitor's Real Price:** 1.86 TND/kg (1.62 TND/kg base price + 15% in farmer's hidden costs).
*   **Our Strategic Sale Price:** **1.49 TND/kg** (A 20% discount to the competitor).

**Total Production Cost Breakdown (per kg):**
*   Barley (at 1.20 TND/kg, 1:5 yield): **0.240 TND**
*   In-House Labor & Vehicle Running Costs: **0.255 TND**
*   **Facility Rent (300 TND/month):** **0.073 TND**
*   System Amortization (3-year lifespan): **0.024 TND**
*   Utilities (Water & Electricity): **0.015 TND**
*   **Total Production Cost:** **0.607 TND/kg**

**Profitability Metrics (Revised):**
*   **Profit Margin per kg:** 1.49 TND (Price) - 0.607 TND (Cost) = **0.883 TND**
*   **Gross Margin:** **59%**
*   **Daily Gross Profit:** 137 kg * 0.883 TND = **121 TND**
*   **Monthly Gross Profit:** **3,630 TND**

**2. Initial Capital Requirement: A De-risked Investment (Revised)**

The total capital ask has been updated to include a 2-month runway for facility rent.

**Total Ask: 23,620 TND**

This capital is allocated with precision:

*   **Capital Expenditures (CapEx): 18,700 TND**
    *   **Fodder Production System:** 3,700 TND for the complete build-out.
    *   **Delivery Vehicle:** 15,000 TND for operational control and margin security.

*   **Operating Capital (OpEx): 4,920 TND**
    *   This provides a **2-month runway** to cover all operational costs while we onboard initial customers. This now includes:
        *   Raw Materials (Barley): 2,020 TND
        *   Labor & Vehicle Costs: 2,100 TND
        *   **Facility Rent:** **600 TND**
        *   Utilities: 200 TND

**3. Use of Funds & Timeline**

(The timeline remains the same, with the addition of securing the lease in Month 1)

*   **Month 1:** Capital injection. **Secure lease on production facility.** Immediate acquisition of vehicle and materials. System construction and commissioning.
*   **Month 2:** System testing and optimization. Begin farmer outreach and sign up initial delivery contracts.
*   **Month 3:** Commence full-scale production and delivery operations. First revenue generated.

### **Page 3: The Investment Case - Why "Project Resilience"? (Revised)**

**1. A Bet on Necessity, Not Luxury**

(This section remains unchanged)

You are not investing in a speculative tech venture. You are investing in a solution to a fundamental economic need. Farmers *must* feed their animals. Our product is an operational essential that is cheaper and better than the alternative. This creates durable, non-cyclical demand.

**2. A Defensible Business Model (With Realistic Costs)**

Even after accounting for all operational costs including rent, the business maintains a **gross margin of 59%**. This demonstrates the robustness of the model. Our competitive advantage is our operational and logistical efficiency.

*   **Customer Density:** Focusing on a tight geographic cluster of farmers minimizes our largest variable cost: delivery.
*   **Supply Chain Control:** Owning our vehicle and sourcing barley locally insulates us from the external shocks that plague our competitors.
*   **First-Mover Advantage:** By establishing ourselves as the trusted, reliable, low-cost provider in our target region, we will build a loyal customer base that will be difficult to displace.

**3. Scalability & Vision**

(This section remains unchanged)

The initial 23,620 TND investment is the seed for a much larger vision. The single production node is a blueprint.

*   **The Path to Growth:** Once this first node is optimized and consistently profitable (target: Month 6), the profits generated will be used to self-fund the establishment of a second node in an adjacent region.
*   **Hub-and-Spoke Model:** Our long-term vision is a network of these nodes across key agricultural regions, all operating from the same efficient playbook.

**4. The Founder-Investor Alignment**

(This section remains unchanged)

We are proposing a straightforward equity deal that aligns our interests perfectly. We seek a partner, not just a lender. The founder's equity will be subject to a standard 4-year vesting schedule, ensuring a long-term commitment to executing this plan and generating a significant return for all shareholders.
