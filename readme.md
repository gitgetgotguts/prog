### **Pro-Forma Financial Analysis: Project Resilience**

This document provides a detailed financial model for a single fodder production unit. The analysis is based on a set of core operational and financial assumptions to determine the unit's Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), profitability, and key performance indicators.

#### **Table 1: Core Operational & Financial Assumptions**

The entire model is predicated on the following inputs. These assumptions form the baseline for all subsequent calculations.

| Metric | Assumption | Unit | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Daily Production Capacity | 137 | kg/day | Represents 100% operational capacity. |
| Monthly Production Volume | 4,110 | kg/month | (137 kg/day * 30 days) |
| Sale Price per Unit | 1.490 | TND/kg | Strategically positioned at a 20% discount to competitor's estimated real cost. |
| Barley Cost (Input) | 1.200 | TND/kg | Cost of primary raw material. |
| Fodder Yield Ratio | 5:1 | | 5 kg of fodder produced from 1 kg of barley. |
| Fixed Monthly OPEX | 2,500 | TND | All-inclusive cost for facility lease, labor, and third-party logistics. |
| System Capital Expenditure (CapEx) | 3,700 | TND | One-time cost for the production system. |
| Asset Depreciable Life | 3 | Years | Straight-line depreciation over 36 months. |

#### **Table 2: Per-Unit Cost Structure & COGS Analysis**

This table dissects the total cost structure and allocates it on a per-kilogram basis to determine the final Cost of Goods Sold (COGS).

| Cost Component | Type | Monthly Cost (TND) | **Cost per Unit (TND/kg)** | Calculation Detail |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Barley Input** | Variable | 986.40 | **0.240** | `(4,110 kg / 5) * 1.20 TND` |
| **Fixed Operational Costs** | Fixed | 2,500.00 | **0.608** | `2,500 TND / 4,110 kg` |
| **Depreciation** | Non-Cash Fixed | 102.78 | **0.025** | `3,700 TND / 36 months` |
| **Utilities (Estimate)** | Semi-Variable | 61.65 | **0.015** | `0.015 TND * 4,110 kg` |
| **Total Cost of Production** | | **3,650.83** | **0.888** | **(Sum of Above)** |

*   **COGS per Unit:** For financial reporting, the COGS is primarily the direct variable cost. In this model, that is **0.240 TND/kg (Barley)**. The fixed operational costs are classified as SG&A (Sales, General & Administrative) or operational overheads.

#### **Table 3: Profitability Projections @ 100% Capacity Utilization**

This table outlines the projected profitability of the unit, calculating key metrics from the revenue and cost structures defined above.

| Metric | Per-Unit (TND/kg) | Monthly (TND) | Calculation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue** | **1.490** | **6,123.90** | `1.490 * 4,110` |
| Less: COGS (Barley) | (0.240) | (986.40) | |
| **Gross Profit** | **1.250** | **5,137.50** | |
| **Gross Margin** | **83.9%** | | `(1.250 / 1.490)` |
| | | | |
| Less: Fixed OPEX | (0.608) | (2,500.00) | |
| Less: Utilities | (0.015) | (61.65) | |
| **EBITDA** | **0.627** | **2,575.85** | *(Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization)* |
| **EBITDA Margin** | **42.1%** | | `(2,575.85 / 6,123.90)` |
| | | | |
| Less: Depreciation | (0.025) | (102.78) | |
| **Net Operating Profit (EBIT)** | **0.602** | **2,473.07** | |
| **Net Profit Margin** | **40.4%** | | `(2,473.07 / 6,123.90)` |

#### **Table 4: Sensitivity Analysis - Monthly Net Operating Profit (EBIT)**

An investor's primary concern is risk associated with key assumptions. This sensitivity analysis demonstrates how the Monthly Net Operating Profit (EBIT) is impacted by fluctuations in the two most critical variables: **Capacity Utilization** and **Barley Cost**.

| **Capacity Utilization** | 
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Barley Cost** | **80%** (3,288 kg/mo) | **90%** (3,699 kg/mo) | **100%** (4,110 kg/mo) |
| **1.10 TND/kg** | 1,848 TND | 2,242 TND | **2,636 TND** |
| **1.20 TND/kg (Base)** | 1,519 TND | 1,996 TND | **2,473 TND** |
| **1.30 TND/kg** | 1,190 TND | 1,750 TND | **2,310 TND** |

**Analysis of Sensitivity:**
*   The model demonstrates resilience, remaining profitable even with a 10 TND cent increase in barley cost and operating at only 80% capacity.
*   The break-even point is well below these tested scenarios, indicating a significant margin of safety.
*   The most critical driver of profitability is **maintaining high capacity utilization**, as this distributes the substantial fixed OPEX over a larger volume of product, directly improving the net margin.
